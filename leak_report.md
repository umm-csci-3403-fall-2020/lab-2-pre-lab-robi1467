# Leak report

## Memory Leaks Beginning Ideas

### Strip
	The memory in this function comes from the array result, this one cannot just be closed since what is causing this leak is also being returned so if `free()` is used before the return statement its going to fundemently change the program. Though result can\'t be free I am inclined to belelieve str can be here. Hopefully I am right

### Is cleaned 
	This memory leak seems to be fairly simple it is from the variable cleaned. Luckily this variable is only used here so it can be freed here as well.

### Main
	Main might have a memory leak with the array of strings but I am not entirly sure

## End 
 	So I was definitly wrong about my ideas to fix the leaks... besides for `is_cleaned()`. So initially I figured the leak would need to be closed directly in `strip()` but that wasn't right since the item was being used outside of it and str just didn't need it. In `main` I thought it would be need on the all of the Strings but from what I gathered it is not needed since the array is not being set up dynamically. while cleaned in `is_clean` is from result in `strip` which is.
	Freeing `cleaned` frees the allocated memory in `result` since its stuff is moved there
